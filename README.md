A mapping engine and tags mapping for a catalog are components designed to organize and categorize information about products, brands, and sellers within a catalog or marketplace. These components help improve searchability, navigation, and overall user experience. Here's a brief overview:

Mapping Engine:

A mapping engine is a system or module that establishes relationships and associations between different entities within a catalog, such as sellers, brands, and products. It helps create a structured representation of the catalog data, making it easier to query and retrieve information. The mapping engine typically stores information about how different entities are interconnected, enabling efficient navigation and exploration of the catalog. Tags Mapping:

Tags mapping involves assigning descriptive labels or tags to products, brands, or sellers based on specific attributes or characteristics. Tags act as metadata that provide additional information about the entities in the catalog. Tags can be associated with various attributes such as product categories, features, brand characteristics, or seller attributes. The tags mapping helps in categorizing and classifying items, making it easier for users to find relevant products or information within the catalog. Key Functions:

Brand Mapping: Associates brands with relevant information such as the list of sellers offering the brand, associated product categories, and any additional tags.

Product Mapping: Establishes connections between products and relevant details such as the brand, seller information, product categories, and associated tags.

Seller Mapping: Links sellers to pertinent information, including the brands they offer, the product categories they specialize in, and any specific tags associated with their offerings.

Tags Mapping: Captures the relationships between tags and various entities, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the catalog's organizational structure.

Benefits:

Improved Search and Navigation: Users can easily find products or sellers based on specific criteria, thanks to the organized structure and tags associated with each entity.

Enhanced User Experience: A well-structured catalog with meaningful tags and associations contributes to a more user-friendly and intuitive browsing experience.

Efficient Data Retrieval: The mapping engine enables quick and efficient retrieval of relevant information, reducing the time and effort required for users to locate desired items.

Personalization and Recommendations: Tags mapping can be leveraged to implement personalized recommendations for users based on their preferences and browsing history.
